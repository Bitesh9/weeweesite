Investing is the act of putting time, money or anything of value into something in hopes of making profit. For example, when you buy shares of a company you use your money. Then when the prices for that share go up, you sell it, to make a profit. Another example is if you want to start a business you need to put in time and money to create it. Investing happens everywhere in life; however, this website will teach you how to successfully invest in wall street by buying share of companies.</p></div>
